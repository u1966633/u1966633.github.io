                Amazcat was an ambitious project dealing with an e-commerce for Catalan shops, focused on street shops so that they could enter the Internet world and reach the rest of the country.
                As a very large project, I was able to play many programming languages and others such as PHP, HTML, CSS, SQL or Javascript. I worked with very good people who were able to help me with many aspects.
