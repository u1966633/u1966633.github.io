# Characterize the final user:
The final user of my curriculum website is usually someone like a prospective employer or anyone wanting to know more about my qualifications. They visit the website with the expectation of finding a well-structured and comprehensive overview of my professional background, education, work experience, skills, and any noteworthy accomplishments. I've designed the website to ensure that this information is presented clearly and in an aesthetically pleasing way, making it simple for users to evaluate my suitability for a job or other opportunities. Essentially, the website serves as a digital representation of my qualifications, aiding users in making informed decisions about my suitability for their needs.

# Information architecture
I have divided the project into four sections, about me, summary, portfoli and contact. Each on a different page, accessible from the menu

# Visual design
Because the most important project I've ever done has been that of Amazcat, I wanted to use your colors to make my curriculum, these are the combination of a main color, an orange, with different greys and black. I think it was a good choice of colours at the time.
With regard to the design of the website in general, I wanted to put a menu to be able to browse the different pages, then each of them has a title and then its content.
